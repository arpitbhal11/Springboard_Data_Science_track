    "First, I looked at the heatmap of the numeric variables to identify how they correlate, which were mostly the variables showing the current strength of economy. The economic indicators demonstrated a strong correlation with each other. Additionally, the 'previous' and 'pdays' variables demonstrated a strong negative correlation, as expected, since the largest value of 'pdays' (999) corresponds to the smallest value of 'previous' (0)."

    "- 'cons.price.idx' - 'nr.employed'\n",
    "- 'euribor3m' - 'nr.employed'\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I checked if the categorical variables were independent of each other using a chi-square test with a 95% level of confidence. I checked the following pairs (it didn't make much sense to do a chi-square test for days of the week or months, and the dependence/independence of the outcome of the previous campaign should have been checked by a more comprehensive method, like logistic regression).\n",

    "Finally, I performed a two-sample z-test to evaluate if the groups within our categorical variables differed significantly in whether they subscribe for the deposit or not. To do that, I grouped different levels of each categorical variable into two groups and calculated the z-score and the p-value. The null hypothesis for the test was that there's no difference between those two groups with respect to the subscription to the deposit. \n",

    "1) All correlations between the pairs of the numeric variables are statistically significant, since the p-values are very close to zero. For two of the pairs, though - namely, 'cons.price.idx' - 'euribor3m' and 'cons.price.idx' - 'nr.employed' - the correlation coefficient isn't high. We can potentially combine these variables into one weighted variable that would represent the state of the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Bootstrapping of the mean age of the dataset demonstrated that the mean of our dataset is very close to the mean of the sampling distribution of the bootstrapped samples' means. Hence, our dataset represents the overall population well, and there's no skew towards any particular age.\n",

    "3) Based on the results of the chi-squared tests, we conclude that:\n",

    "- Job level depends on the level of education\n",
    "- Job level is independend from the absence or presence of a housing loan\n",

    "- Absence or presence of a housing loan depends on the type of contact\n",
    "- Absence or presence of a personal loan is independent from the type of contact\n",
